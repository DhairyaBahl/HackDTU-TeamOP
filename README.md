We created this website as a part of HackDTU Hackathon. The theme of the Hackathon is Open Innovation.

## Inspiration
Ever since online classes started, students have been receiving notes on WhatsApp Groups which are very disorganised and are very tiresome to study through especially 
during exam time. So we made a website for properly organised notes which can be easily accessed by all.

## What it does
Mera Notes allow students to view all the notes catagorised and organised in proper manner. Students can easily make an account or connect their google account to easily
connect to the website to upload their respective notes in the correct categories.
