We created this website as a part of HackDTU Hackathon. The theme of the Hackathon is Open Innovation.

## Inspiration
Ever since online classes started, we have been receiving notes on WhatsApp groups that are very disorganized and are very tiresome to study through especially during exam time. More time is spent on organizing the notes than
studying suing the said notes. So we decided to make a website where all students can access Notes for convenient studying and less time is spent on organizing notes. Students can also help the community and their fellow students by uploading their own notes on the website. 


## What it does
Mera Notes is a website for accessing notes which are readily available for
students by students.  
Mera Notes allow students to view all the notes categorized and organized in a proper manner. Students can easily contribute to the community by uploading their own notes in a pdf format for other students to access and get benefits from the notes. The website is easily accessible as long as you have a device with an internet connection and a browser and all the notes are available to you on the go.

## How we built it
While developing our product, we had to ensure that our solution, while fulfilling the consumerâ€™s need, also remains highly fault-tolerant, scalable, and available. Therefore, we made our system design decisions in order to ensure a robust product. 
* We utilized ReactJS as our primary technology for the consumer-facing side of the product to ensure better performance.
* We used HTML and CSS to structure and stylize our Front-End
* For our database, storage, and hosting needs, considering our structure, we chose Firebase due to its high availability. 
## Challenges we ran into
One of the major challenges that we faced was using Firebase since it was a 
completely new experience for our team. We had an especially hard time 
making and linking the database to our Front-End but we managed to get the 
Back-End up and running before the deadline without any hitch.

## What we learned
This Hackathon has helped our team learn ins and outs of an entirely new 
platform, Firebase for database storage and hosting purposes. 
We also improved our ReactJS, HTML, and CSS skills a lot. 
Thanks to the pressure of meeting deadlines, we learned a huge deal in a 
short duration.
